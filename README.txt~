INTRODUCTION:

     AssemblyZipper will be a pipeline to integrate two assemblies from
  the same species.

     One of the assemblies should be defined as Reference (usually the bigger),
  and the other as Query. This pipeline will have the following steps:

  1. Query fragmentation:
     
     Query assembly will be fragmented into 100 bp fragments.

  2. Query framents mapping:
  
     These fragments will be mapped with the Reference asssembly using a NGS
     mapping tool such as bwa.

  3. Overlaps processing and classification:

     The mapping coordinates will be processed and the Query sequences will
     be classified according the match and the overlap.

     +----------------+------------------------+------------------+
     | Matches Number | Overlap Type           | Classification   |
     +----------------+------------------------+------------------+
     | 1              | Full                   | Redundant        |
     | 1              | Partial                | Extension        |
     | 2              | Partial No Overlapping | Gap-Join         |
     | 2              | Partial Overlapping    | Overlap-Join     |
     | >2             | Partial                | Conflict         |
     +----------------+------------------------+------------------+

  4. Sequence Clustering:

     Starting with the Extension Overlaps, it will get
